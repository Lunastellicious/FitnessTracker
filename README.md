 Coding Conventions & Guidelines
===========================

🧠 Naming:
- Use camelCase for variable names.
- Choose intuitive and descriptive names (no random letters or inside jokes).

🧹 Code Style:
- Aim for semi-clean coding: readable, structured, but not over-engineered.
- Maintain proper indentations (use 4 spaces or your team’s standard).
- Avoid hardcoding values — use constants, config files, or variables instead.

🌿 Workflow:
- Work in branches or within delegation groups.
- Merge only when the team is assembled and code has been reviewed together.

📝 Documentation:
- Required for all functions and modules.
- Keep it short, precise, and meaningful — explain *why*, not *what*.

🎉 Bonus:
- If there’s extra time, write a short fanfic in the merge message.
  It builds team spirit and keeps the vibes immaculate. ✨

📍 Offset:
- (Add any offset-related notes here.)
